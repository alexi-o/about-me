a) I worked in online marketing for a multi-brand franchise company where I helped facilitate relationships between our franchisees and online marketing vendors, managed an SEO program for all of our corporate websites as well as a handful of franchisees, and acted as the unoffical IT support for office staff. I also fixed a broken toilet.

b) My primary need from Outcomes is help on determining what exactly I want to do. I like the idea of being a 'jack of all trades' since I enjoy new challenges but I also fear that same thing since I know that could mean being spread incredibly thin. I also realize that this is only Day 3 and I'll probably figure this out as I move through the program and realize my strengths.

c) Here are three interesting facts about me!
	1) I used to share a room with my friend in LA where I slept on the floor.
	2) I'm no longer a woman.
	3) According to self-diagnosis via WebMD, I've had scurvy (like pirates).
