#About Me

## Before GA:
I worked in online marketing for a multi-brand franchise company where I helped facilitate relationships between our franchisees and online marketing vendors, managed an SEO program for all of our corporate websites as well as a handful of franchisees, and acted as the unoffical IT support for office staff. I also fixed a broken toilet.

## Outcomes Support I need:
My primary need from Outcomes is help on determining what exactly I want to do. I like the idea of being a 'jack of all trades' since I enjoy new challenges but I also fear that same thing since I know that could mean being spread incredibly thin. I also realize that this is only Day 3 and I'll probably figure this out as I move through the program and realize my strengths.

## Day 1 Goals;
Project Goal: I'd like to develop an app, what kind I'm not sure, ideally one that makes the world a better place to live. 

General Goal: I'd like to enter a career in web dev that I find both rewarding and challenging, and subsequently make the world a better place to live.

## Two Truths and a Lie
1) I used to share a room with my friend in LA where I slept on the floor.
2) I'm no longer a woman.
3) According to self-diagnosis via WebMD, I've had scurvy (like pirates).
